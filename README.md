Tanks ( Improved )

An extension to the Unity's tutorial game "Tanks" with a tank run by artificial intelligence which targets either of the player tanks dynamically. Also a limit over the player's ammo has been added. Target player is dynamically chosen conisdering multiple factors such as player's health, distance from the tank run by CPU and ammo left. Hiding spots have been introduced for enabling the player to stay away invisible from the CPU controlled tank.
